# DEEP LEARNING

In this section, i have used Keras and TensorFlow library and python code in Jupyter Notebook.

## 1. How works Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

    - In this assignment we will learn how perceptrons work and are trained.

## 2. Lab assignment: classifying digits with Deep Networks (CNN).

    - In this assignment we will face the problem of recognizing handwritten digits. We will see how in order to achieve maximum effectiveness we will need to resort to several Deep Learning techniques.


## 3. Lab assignment: analyzing movie reviews with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM)

    - In this assignment we will analyze the sentiment, positive or negative, expressed in a set of movie reviews IMDB. To do so we will make use of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks.
